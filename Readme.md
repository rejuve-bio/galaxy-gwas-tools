# Galaxy GWAS Tools

A collection of modular and reproducible Galaxy tools for genome-wide association studies (GWAS), including:

- Summary statistics munging 
- Variant-level filtering and annotation
- GCTA COJO conditional analysis
- SuSiE fine-mapping
- VCF processing with 1000 Genomes reference data

Each tool is designed to be small, independent, and Galaxy-compliant, with a one-script-per-tool principle (`.py` + `.xml`), allowing easy integration into any Galaxy-based bioinformatics workflow.
