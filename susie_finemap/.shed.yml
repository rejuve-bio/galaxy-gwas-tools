description: "Runs SuSiE fine-mapping using GWAS summary statistics and LD matrices."
long_description: >
  This tool wraps the R package `susieR` to perform summary-statistics-based fine-mapping.
  It takes GWAS effect sizes (BETA, SE), a linkage disequilibrium (LD) matrix, and a
  corresponding SNP list as input. The tool applies SuSiE (Sum of Single Effects) regression
  to identify credible sets of causal variants and computes posterior inclusion probabilities
  (PIPs) for each SNP. Outputs include a table of credible sets and a SNPâ€“PIP file, suitable
  for downstream fine-mapping and genetic architecture analyses.
